# FitFindr — planning.md

> Complete this document before writing any implementation code.
> Your spec and agent diagram are what you'll use to direct AI tools (Claude, Copilot, etc.) to generate your implementation — the more specific they are, the more useful the generated code will be.
> Your planning.md will be reviewed as part of your submission.
> Update it before starting any stretch features.

## Tools

List every tool your agent will use. For each tool, fill in all four fields.
You must have at least 3 tools. The three required tools are listed — add any additional tools below them.

### Tool 1: search_listings

**What it does:**
<!-- Describe what this tool does in 1–2 sentences -->

**Input parameters:**
<!-- List each parameter, its type, and what it represents -->
- `description` (str): ...
- `size` (str): ...
- `max_price` (float): ...

**What it returns:**
<!-- Describe the return value — what fields does a result contain? -->

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**
<!-- What should the agent do if no listings match? -->

---

### Tool 2: suggest_outfit

**What it does:**
<!-- Describe what this tool does in 1–2 sentences -->

**Input parameters:**
<!-- List each parameter, its type, and what it represents -->
- `new_item` (dict): ...
- `wardrobe` (dict): ...

**What it returns:**
<!-- Describe the return value -->

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**
<!-- What should the agent do if the wardrobe is empty or no outfit can be suggested? -->

---

### Tool 3: create_fit_card

**What it does:**
<!-- Describe what this tool does in 1–2 sentences -->

**Input parameters:**
<!-- List each parameter, its type, and what it represents -->
- `outfit` (...): ...

**What it returns:**
<!-- Describe the return value -->

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**
<!-- What should the agent do if the outfit data is incomplete? -->

---

### Additional Tools (if any)

<!-- Copy the block above for any tools beyond the required three -->

---

## Planning Loop

**How does your agent decide which tool to call next?**
<!-- Describe the logic your planning loop uses. What does it look at? What conditions change its behavior? How does it know when it's done? -->

---

## State Management

**How does information from one tool get passed to the next?**
<!-- Describe how your agent stores and accesses state within a session. What data is tracked? How is it passed between tool calls? -->

---

## Error Handling

For each tool, describe the specific failure mode you're handling and what the agent does in response.

| Tool | Failure mode | Agent response |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| search_listings | No results match the query | |
| suggest_outfit | Wardrobe is empty | |
| create_fit_card | Outfit input is missing or incomplete | |

---

## Architecture

<!-- Draw a diagram of your agent showing how the components connect:
     User input → Planning Loop → Tools (search_listings, suggest_outfit, create_fit_card)
                                                                          ↕
                                                                   State / Session
     Show what triggers each tool, how state flows between them, and where error paths branch off.
     ASCII art, a Mermaid diagram (https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html), or an embedded
     sketch are all fine. You'll share this diagram with an AI tool when asking it to implement
     the planning loop and each individual tool. -->

## AI Tool Plan

<!-- For each part of the implementation below, describe:
     - Which AI tool you plan to use (Claude, Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
     - What you'll give it as input (which sections of this planning.md, your agent diagram)
     - What you expect it to produce
     - How you'll verify the output matches your spec before moving on

     "I'll use AI to help me code" is not a plan.
     "I'll give Claude my Tool 1 spec (inputs, return value, failure mode) and ask it to implement
     search_listings() using load_listings() from the data loader — then test it against 3 queries
     before trusting it" is a plan. -->

**Milestone 3 — Individual tool implementations:**

**Milestone 4 — Planning loop and state management:**

## A Complete Interaction (Step by Step)

Write out what a full user interaction looks like from start to finish — tool call by tool call. Use a specific example query.
FitFindr helps a user shop secondhand by first searching listings that match the requested item, size, budget, and style language, then styling the best match with pieces from the user's wardrobe, then turning the outfit into a short social-style fit card. `search_listings` is triggered by the user's shopping request; if it returns no matches, the agent explains what to broaden or change and stops instead of calling `suggest_outfit`. When a listing is found, `suggest_outfit` uses the selected item plus the wardrobe, and `create_fit_card` runs only after a usable outfit suggestion exists.

**Example user query:** "I'm looking for a vintage graphic tee under $30. I mostly wear baggy jeans and chunky sneakers. What's out there and how would I style it?"

**Step 1:**
<!-- What does the agent do first? Which tool is called? With what input? -->
The agent parses the shopping request and calls `search_listings(description="vintage graphic tee", size=None, max_price=30.0)`. The tool searches listing fields such as title, description, category, style_tags, size, condition, price, colors, brand, and platform, then returns matching listings sorted by relevance.
**Step 2:**
<!-- What happens next? What was returned from step 1? What tool is called now? -->
The agent selects the top returned listing, such as "Graphic Tee — 2003 Tour Bootleg Style" for $24 on Depop, and stores it as `new_item`. It then calls `suggest_outfit(new_item=<selected listing>, wardrobe=<user wardrobe>)`, using wardrobe items like baggy jeans, chunky sneakers, boots, jackets, and accessories to build a cohesive look.

**Step 3:**
<!-- Continue until the full interaction is complete -->
If `suggest_outfit` returns a usable outfit, the agent calls `create_fit_card(outfit=<outfit suggestion>, new_item=<selected listing>)`. This turns the listing and styling advice into a concise caption-style fit card that mentions the thrifted item, price, platform, and outfit vibe.

**Final output to user:**
<!-- What does the user actually see at the end? -->
The user sees the best matching listing, a styling suggestion using their wardrobe, and a ready-to-post fit card. If no listings match the search, the user instead sees a helpful message suggesting changes like increasing the budget, removing the size filter, or broadening the style keywords, and the agent does not continue to outfit or fit-card generation.
